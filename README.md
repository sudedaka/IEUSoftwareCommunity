# IUE Software Community

## Overview

This project aims to provide a central platform for the **IUE Software Community** members to facilitate internal club announcements, improve communication, and streamline various tasks. The platform enables users to get information about club events, provide feedback, and contact the management easily.

Built with *ReactJS* and styled with *TailwindCSS*, the platform offers a modern, responsive interface. We’ve also integrated *Google Forms* for feedback collection and have secured a custom domain for easy access.
